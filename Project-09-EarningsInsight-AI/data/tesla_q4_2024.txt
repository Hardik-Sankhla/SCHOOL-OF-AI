[Operator]: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Tesla Q4 2024 Earnings Call.

[CEO]: Good morning. We had an exceptionally strong fourth quarter, closing out 2024 with record deliveries and robust financial performance. Vehicle deliveries for Q4 reached 500,000 units, a 12% increase year-over-year, driven primarily by strong demand for Model 3 and Model Y. Our energy generation and storage business also saw significant growth, with deployments up 25% compared to the previous quarter. We remain committed to our long-term vision of accelerating the world's transition to sustainable energy. We are investing heavily in AI-driven manufacturing processes and expanding our Gigafactories globally, particularly in Texas and Berlin. We anticipate continued strong growth into 2025, with vehicle deliveries projected to increase by over 20%. However, we are closely monitoring supply chain constraints, especially for certain battery components, which could pose a challenge.

[CFO]: Financially, Q4 was solid. Total revenue for the quarter was $28 billion, up 15% year-over-year. Gross margin improved to 22%, reflecting efficiency gains and favorable product mix. Operating income remained stable at $4.5 billion. Our cash position remains strong at $25 billion, providing ample liquidity for our ambitious expansion plans. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $2.5 billion, primarily directed towards factory expansion and new product development. We expect capital expenditures to increase slightly in Q1 2025 as we ramp up new production lines. Inflationary pressures on raw materials continue to be a factor, but our cost optimization efforts are helping to mitigate these impacts. We are confident in achieving our full-year 2025 financial targets.

[Analyst 1]: Thank you for the update. Could you clarify how inflation is affecting your capital expenditure plans for 2025, specifically regarding the Gigafactory expansions?

[CEO]: Inflation is certainly a factor, but we've locked in many long-term contracts for materials and equipment. Our focus on vertical integration also helps us manage costs. While we anticipate some upward pressure, we don't foresee it significantly derailing our expansion timelines or overall capital expenditure budget. We're building for the long term.

[Analyst 2]: Regarding the 20% delivery growth projection for 2025, what are the primary drivers you expect, and what are the biggest risks to achieving that target?

[CEO]: The primary drivers are continued strong demand for Model Y, the ramp-up of Cybertruck production, and expansion into new markets. The biggest risk, as I mentioned, is the supply chain for specific battery materials. Geopolitical tensions could also unexpectedly impact logistics. We are actively working to diversify our sourcing to mitigate these risks.
